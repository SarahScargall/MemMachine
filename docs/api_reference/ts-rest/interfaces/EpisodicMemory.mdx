## Interface `EpisodicMemory`

Episodic memories represent specific events or interactions in a chronological sequence. Think of these as the individual "moments" the AI remembers.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` | The unique identifier for this specific memory entry. |
| `content` | `string` | The raw text or data of the memory. |
| `role` | `MemoryProducerRole` | The role of the creator (e.g., `user`, `assistant`). |
| `orgId` | `string` | The organization ID associated with this memory. |
| `projectId` | `string` | The project ID associated with this memory. |
| `userId` | `string` | *Optional.* The specific user associated with the interaction. |
| `createdAt` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the memory was stored. |
| `metadata` | `Record<string, any>` | Additional custom context stored with the memory. |

---

## Interface `SemanticMemory`

Semantic memories (also known as Profile memories) represent distilled knowledge and facts extracted from interactions. These are used for high-level reasoning and background context.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` | Unique identifier for the semantic fact. |
| `featureName` | `string` | The specific trait or feature being described (e.g., `favoriteColor`). |
| `value` | `string` | The factual value of the memory (e.g., `blue`). |
| `category` | `string` | High-level classification like `user_preference`. |
| `score` | `number` | The confidence or relevance score of this fact. |
| `updatedAt` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp of the last time this fact was updated. |

## Usage Example

The current SDK returns a flattened array of results. Use the properties below to format your UI or AI prompts.

```typescript
import { MemMachineClient } from '@memmachine/sdk';

const client = new MemMachineClient({ apiKey: process.env.MEMMACHINE_API_KEY });

// Example of handling retrieved memories
const results = await client.searchProfileMemory({ 
  query: "What are the user's preferences?",
  metadata: { 
    orgId: "org_1", 
    projectId: "proj_A" 
  }
});

results.forEach((memory) => {
  if (memory.featureName) {
    // Handling Semantic/Profile Memory
    console.log(`Fact: ${memory.featureName} is ${memory.value}`);
  } else {
    // Handling Episodic Memory
    console.log(`[${memory.createdAt}] Event: ${memory.content}`);
  }
});

<Note title="Structure Change"> The latest SDK version has moved from snake_case (e.g., created_at) to camelCase (e.g., createdAt) to align with standard TypeScript conventions. </Note>
